# Keras Deep Learning for Custom Image Classification

This project involves the development of a deep learning model for custom image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with the Keras library.

The model utilizes a sequential CNN architecture implemented using Keras for classifying images into four predefined categories.
