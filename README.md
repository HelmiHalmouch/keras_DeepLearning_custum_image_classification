# Keras Deep Learning for Custom Image Classification

This project involves the development of a deep learning model for custom image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with the Keras library.

The model utilizes a sequential CNN architecture implemented using Keras for classifying images into four predefined categories.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.5 or higher
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (sklearn)
- OpenCV

You can install the necessary packages using the following commands:

pip install keras matplotlib scikit-learn opencv-python
